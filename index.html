#jQuery

---
## What is jQuery?

jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.

The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.
jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.
It also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.
---
## History

Why did jQuery become so popular in the first place?

First, jQuery was born in a world where JavaScript applications weren’t a thing.
In the early-mid 2000s JavaScript was mainly used to power slideshows and other widgets that appeared inside a page, like image galleries,
date pickers and so on. It wasn’t powerful enough to do a lot of things without being too slow (computers were slower too, of course).

Browsers at the time had a lot of interoperability issues. We had lots of cross-browser quirks and standardization issues, and jQuery
helped us by creating an abstraction layer and taking care of al the workarounds.
jQuery allowed you to select DOM elements using the CSS selectors syntax, it was very user friendly and very simple to extend.
It made JavaScript animations simple.
It also helped simplify working with AJAX (and its cross-browser differences) at a time when this term was super popular,
and this also gave jQuery a nice boost in term of popularity.

##Get Started

Add downloaded library

```html
<script src="jquery-3.4.1.min.js"></script>
```

or use jQuery/Google/Microsoft Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)

```html
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
```

or use npm

```javascript
npm install jquery
```
or yarn

```javascript
yarn add jquery
```

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity

---

##The focus of jQuery

```javascript
$('#purchase_btn').addClass('focal');
```

- $() - call jQuery
- '#someid' - get elements with css like selector
- .addClass() - do something to selected elements

---

##Selectors

###Basic
```css
'*', elementTag, #id, .class
```
###Hierarchy
```css
parent > child, prev + next, prev ~ siblings
```

---

##Selectors
###Filters
```css
:not(), :empty
:hidden /* display: none, type="hidden", width & height = 0, ancestor is hidden */
:visible /* are visible */
:parent /* are parents to other elements, including text node */
:contains() /* contain the specified text */
:has() /* contain at least one element that matches the specified selector */
```

<s>
```css
:even, :odd, :first, :last
:gt() /* all elements at an index greater then specified */
:lt() /* all elements at an index less then specified */

```
</s>

---

##Selectors
###Attribute
```css
[name], [name|='value'], [name*='value'], [name~='value'],
[name$='value'], [name^='value']
[name!='value'] /* either no such attribute or specified value */
```
https://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/attribute-selectors/

https://css-tricks.com/attribute-selectors/


###Child filters
```css
:first-child, :last-child, :only-child, :first-of-type, :last-of-type,
:only-of-type, :nth-child(), :nth-last-child(), :nth-last-of-type(),
:nth-of-type()
```
https://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/child-filter-selectors/

https://css-tricks.com/pseudo-class-selectors/

---

##Selectors
###Forms
```css
:button, :checkbox, :file, :image, :input, :password, :radio, :reset,
:submit, :text, :disabled, :enabled, :focus, :checked, :selected
```

https://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/form-selectors/

---
###Traversing

Though traversing is quite a powerfull tool, it is wiser not to abbuse it too much.
Overcomplicated selectors are hard to understand and affect performance.
Note: find() is an exception, sometimes gives performance benefits

```javascript
is(), not(), has()
eq(), first(), last()
find(), parent(), parents(), closest()
children(), prev(), next(), siblings()
```

https://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/

---

##DOM manipulations

###Attributes
```javascript
attr(), prop(), val(), data()
removeAttr(), removeProp()
```
Note: as lots of other methods, could be used as both getters and setters
```javascript
$('input').attr('type'); // "checkbox"
$('input').attr('disabled', true); // [<input type="text" disabled="disabled">]
```

###CSS
```javascript
css() // sets inline style. ( { 'top' : 5, 'right' : 4 } ) or ( 'top', 5 )
addClass(), removeClass(), hasClass()
toggleClass(),
$(element).hasClass(class) ? removeClass(class) : addClass(class)
```

---
##DOM manipulations

```javascript
html(), text() // get/set html/text
$('<div>') // create element
remove() // removes element from DOM
append(), prepend() // insert specified content to the end/beginning of element
after(), before() // insert content after/before element
height(), width() // get/set value
clone() // create a deep copy of an element
wrap() // wrap element with another element
detach() // same as remove but keeps all jQuery related data
```

https://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/

---

###The Document Ready Event
Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded.

```javascript
$( document ).ready(function() {
  // Handler for .ready() called.
});

$(function() {
  // Handler for .ready() called.
});
```

https://learn.javascript.ru/onload-ondomcontentloaded

---
##Animation

```javascript
hide(), show(), toggle()
fadeOut(), fadeIn(), fadeToggle()
slideOut(), slideDown(), slideToggle()
```

Note: all of these methods accept configurations, e.g {duration: 500}

animate() - animates given css properties.
Note: in most cases it is wiser to use css animations as those are much faster

https://api.jquery.com/category/effects/

---
##Events

###Event Handlers
on(), off(), one(), trigger()

###Form Events
focus(), blur(), change(), submit()

###Keyboard Events
keydown(), keyup(), keypress()

https://api.jquery.com/category/events/

---
##Events

###Mouse Events
click(), dblclick(), hover()

###Event Object
event.preventDefault(), event.stopPropagation(), event.target

Note: some events can be used as both handlers and triggers
$('input').focus(handler) -> attaches handler onFocus
$('input').focus() -> sets focus on input


---
##Ajax

###Basic usage
```javascript
$.ajax({
    type: 'POST',
    url: 'authorization.php',
    data: { login: 'John', password: 'gfhjkm' },
    success: onSuccess,
    error: onError,
    complete: onComplete
  });
```
###Shorthand methods
```javascript
$.get(), $.post()
$.getJSON(), $.getScript()
```

https://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/

---
##Utilities
```javascript
$.each() // generic iterator function
$.extend() // merge the content of second+ objects into first one
$.trim() // remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string
$.isArray(), $.isEmptyObject(), $.isFunction(), $.isNumeric()
$.parseHTML(), $.parseJSON()
```

https://api.jquery.com/category/utilities/

---
##jQuery Plugins

One of the reasons jQuery gained so much popularity is the ease of creating plugins.
Which led to a huge collection of available plugins.
As a tradeoff, lots of those plugins are poorly coded and rarely properly maintained.

```javascript
$.fn.paintMe = function(color){
  this.css('background', color);
  return this;
}
$('p').paintMe('red').text('ima red!!');
```
